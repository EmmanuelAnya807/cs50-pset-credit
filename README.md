# cs50-pset-credit
My solution to a CS50 Problem Set  – Credit Card Validator (using Luhn’s Algorithm)

This project is a Python implementation of the CS50 "Credit" problem.  
The program validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s Algorithm, checks the card length, and identifies the card type (VISA, AMEX, or Mastercard).
